# LightTable

[LightTable](http://www.lighttable.com/) is at first a text editor. Based on node-webkit it is almost entirely written using [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) (a subset of Clojure compiling to Javascript).

The most intriguing feature of LightTable is the rapid feedback of the LiveREPL.
